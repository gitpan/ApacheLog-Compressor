	Provide on_bad_data_event so that unparsable lines can be handled separately.
	Includes some extra code for parsing data as UTF8, including unescaping URLS - currently commented out since
	 in most cases it's either not useful, or just wrong.

	Improve filtering support, basic callbacks for things that need to know when new URL packets etc. are seen,
	 and apply post processing before sending the log line event.

0.002     2011-02-20 04:28:50 Europe/London
	Handle partial incoming data streams for expanding, and avoid sending timestamp
	 for filtered entries.
